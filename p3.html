                                To be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the examined tools we need to have full
                                control of the
                                target Web site and its installed Web analytics tool. Therefore, we will develop and
                                deploy two different
                                victim Web sites and deploy them on the AWS, each using one of the chosen Web analytics
                                tools.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After studying the six listed traffic generating tools above, we will perform the MWAP
                                attack using each
                                of them i.e. generating HTTP(s) requests towards the “target” Web sites and analyze the
                                labelling of
                                these requests by the installed Web analytics tool. As mentioned earlier, the requests
                                that end up being
                                categorized as genuine “human” will imply a successful WAP attack.
