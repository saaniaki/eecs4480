                                The key characteristics of the MWAP attack are that it is very easy to execute, as it does not
                                involve
                                the use of any malware. A Web Analytics Pollution attack is successful when the Web requests
                                generated by the attacker are ultimately labelled as genuine human requests by the Web analytics
                                tool
                                deployed on the target site.

                            <p>
                                There are two main approaches to pollute the analytical data generated by Web analytics tools:
                                Malware-based and Malwareless-based approaches. In this project, we will be analyzing the second
                                approach as it is much easier to conduct and in the real world, such attacks are more preferable
                                due to
                                the lesser cost and complexity.

                                In her previous work, Professor N. Vlajic has described and deployed an experimental
                                framework to
                                study the effectiveness of MWAP attacks. In her paper, Professor N. Vlajic has also
                                provided a brief
                                summary of the key findings which show a clear performance superiority of the Web
                                analytics tools that
                                utilize JavaScript page tags as a means of identifying genuine human-generated
                                Web-requests.
                                However, even such Web analytics tools are not completely prone to MWAP attacks. In
                                fact,
                                Professor N. Vlajic’s work shows the potential of abusing some smarter tools to narrow
                                the adversaries’
                                approach and perform successful MWAP attacks [1].

                                In this project, we will evaluate the overall feasibility and effectiveness of
                                conducting successful MWAP
                                attacks. To make our analysis more realistic, we will be using free and readily
                                available tools traditionally
                                deployed for application layer testing and/or DDoS attacks.
