1- HULK (HTTP Unbearable Load King)

HULK is a web server denial of service tool written for research purposes.
It is designed to generate volumes of unique and obfuscated traffic at a webserver, bypassing caching engines and therefore hitting the server's direct resource pool.

HULK DoS tool ported to Go language from Python: https://github.com/grafov/hulk

pros and cons: https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/hulk-vs-thor-application-dos-smackdown/

usage:

$ sudo apt install docker.io
$ git clone https://github.com/grafov/hulk
$ cd docker/
$ sudo docker build -t hulk .
$ sudo docker run -it hulk -site http://ec2-35-183-239-72.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com



2- DDOSIM - Layer 7 DDoS Simulator

ddosim is a tool that can be used in a laboratory environment to simulate a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack against a target server.
The test will show the capacity of the server to handle application specific DDOS attacks.
ddosim simulates several zombie hosts (having random IP addresses) which create full TCP connections to the target server.
After completing the connection, ddosim starts the conversation with the listening application (e.g. HTTP server).

ddosim is written in C++ and runs on Linux. Its current functionalities include:

* HTTP DDoS with valid requests
* HTTP DDoS with invalid requests (similar to a DC++ attack)
* SMTP DDoS
* TCP connection flood on random port
